This project addresses the XOR classification problem using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and highlights the effectiveness of this approach. The XOR problem is a complex classification situation where the output is '1' only when one of the two inputs is '1', and it is not linearly separable. The primary aim of this research is to explore how such a nonlinear problem can be learned through an ANN model. To this end, a deep ANN model trained with the backpropagation algorithm has been developed. The training process of the model continued until the network achieved accurate classification capabilities, and the results document that the learning process was effectively completed. The project also provides an in-depth examination of the fundamental principles of ANNs and how ANNs can be a powerful solution in solving nonlinear problems like XOR.
